      <p>In a restaurant, the menu is a list of food and beverages offered to customers and the prices. 
        A menu may be à la carte – which presents a list of options from which customers choose – or 
        table d'hôte, in which case a pre-established sequence of courses is offered. Menus may be 
        printed on paper sheets provided to the diners, put on a large poster or display board inside 
        the establishment, displayed outside the restaurant, or put on a digital screen. Since the 
        late 1990s, some restaurants have put their menus online. Menus are also often a feature of 
        very formal meals other than in restaurants, for example at weddings. In the 19th and 
        20th centuries printed menus were often used for society dinner-parties in homes; indeed 
        this was their original use in Europe.
